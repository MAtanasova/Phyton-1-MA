The project extends the following tutorial https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api

build_database.py initializes the database by adding some example users and associated posts.
rest_client.py is a consumer os the REST API

Documentation of the API is automatically generated using Swagger, see http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/ui

There is a Single-Page Applications (SPA) to access different parts of the REST API http://127.0.0.1:5000
